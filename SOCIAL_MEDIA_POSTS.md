Built a Claude Code skill that integrates Codex CLI for independent code reviews - no more copy/pasting between terminals.

**What it does:**
- Type `/codex` in your Claude Code session
- Get instant Codex review of your changes
- Two AI opinions before you commit

Real example: Codex caught missing error handling and password hash issues in test code before I deployed. Different models catch different issues.

Open source, one command to install: https://github.com/adampaulwalker/codex-claude-skill

### Option 1: Problem-Solution Structure
```
The mistake most developers make with AI coding tools is using them in isolation.

I built a Claude Code skill that solves this: it integrates OpenAI's Codex as an independent reviewer directly in your terminal.

Why this matters:

1. No context switching - Type `/codex` and get instant reviews without leaving your session

2. Proposer-checker workflow - Claude implements, Codex reviews, Claude fixes. Two AI opinions before you commit.

3. Production-ready assessments - Get detailed before/after comparisons, not just "looks good"

The result: I caught 2 bugs in test code before deployment that would have made it to production.

Open source, MIT licensed: github.com/adampaulwalker/codex-claude-skill

If you use Claude Code + have Codex CLI, this takes 30 seconds to install.
```

### Option 2: First Principles Approach
```
Here's a first-principles question: why do we still copy/paste between AI coding tools?

When Claude Code writes code, I want a second AI opinion. But switching to Codex means:
- Copy all changed files
- Switch terminals
- Paste into new session
- Copy feedback back
- Repeat

That's 10 steps for something that should be 1.

So I built a Claude Code skill that makes Codex reviews native. Type `/codex`, get instant review.

Two benefits:

1. Speed - Proposer-checker workflow in one terminal
2. Quality - Independent AI review catches what the implementer misses

Open sourced it here: github.com/adampaulwalker/codex-claude-skill

Works with any git repo. Installation is one curl command.

The best workflows eliminate unnecessary friction.
```

### Option 3: Personal Story + Lesson
```
I almost shipped buggy test code yesterday.

Claude Code wrote 2,100+ lines of tests. They looked good. I was ready to deploy.

Then I ran `/codex` - a skill I built that pipes the code to OpenAI's Codex for independent review.

Codex found:
- Missing error handling in 2 functions
- Password hash strength issues
- Inconsistent error messages

Fixed them before deployment. Crisis averted.

The insight: When one AI implements code, get a second AI to review it. Different models catch different issues.

But the workflow was broken - too much copy/paste between tools.

So I built this skill to make Codex reviews native to Claude Code sessions. No context switching.

Open sourced it: github.com/adampaulwalker/codex-claude-skill

If you use AI coding tools, consider implementing a proposer-checker workflow. It's the maker-checker pattern but for AI.

Takes 30 seconds to set up. Might save you from production bugs.
